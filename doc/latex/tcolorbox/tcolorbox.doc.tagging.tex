\section{Tagging}%
\tcbset{external/prefix=external/tagging_}%

The package is partially compatible with tagging.
Thanks to Ulrike Fischer, the following works:

\subsection{Supported}

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic |tcolorbox|es with \refKey{/tcb/capture} mode \docValue{minipage} (this is the standard case).\par
  Capture modes \docValue{hbox} and \docValue{fitbox} are not supported yet.
  The same is true for \refCom{tcbox} and \refCom{tcboxfit}.
\item Upper part and lower part.
\item Breakables |tcolorbox|es.
\item Skins like \refKey{/tcb/enhanced}, \refKey{/tcb/bicolor}, etc.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item The tagging code inserts additional |\par|'s before and after a |tcolorbox|.
  This may (will) interact with \refKey{/tcb/before} and \refKey{/tcb/after} settings.
  Especially, \refKey{/tcb/nobeforeafter} will not work as expected.
\item \refEnv{tcbraster} cannot have more than one column, because of the
  additional |\par|'s caused by tagging.
\item Boxed titles will not be tagged.
\end{itemize}
